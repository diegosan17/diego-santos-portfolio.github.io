      <h4>Character Quiz</h4>
      <a href="https://diegosan17.github.io/Character-Quiz/" target="_blank"><img src="gravity.png" alt="characterquiz" id="falls"></a>
      <figcaption>This project's task was to make a quiz that at the end gives you a character from a show. <br>You answered questions and it will give you the character that most relates to your answers. <br>This project tested our understanding of using if/else condtionals in javascript and <br>I feel I was able to learn a lot through the project making process. <br>A big challenge for me throughout this project was making sure that my if/else statements worked. <br>I took a lot of debugging but I eventually figured it out.</figcaption>
      
      <h4>Adventure Game</h4>
      <a href="https://diegosan17.github.io/Unit-6-Project/" target="_blank"><img src="target.png" alt="targetgame" id="target"></a>
      <figcaption>For this project we had to make an adventure game using jquery actions. <br>This project was the first time I was seeing these new actions and learning them was an important part to doing this project. <br>My biggest challenge I faced was definitely the restart button. <br>With the click of the button we we're supposed to be brought back to the beginning of the game and I could not figure out why what I was doing was wrong.<br> I made it so that it would hide everything not needed for the first page and showed everything it did need, but it wouldn't work so I made it<br> so when you click the button it links you back to the first page.</figcaption>

      <h4>Social Media Page</h4>
      <a href="https://diegosan17.github.io/socialmediapage/" target="_blank"><img src="denzel.png" alt="denzel" id="zel"></a>
      <figcaption>For this project we had to make a social media page for someone we classified as a hero. <br>I chose my favorite artist Denzel Curry. <br>I felt like when making this project it helped me better understand the flexbox tool.<br> I understood what each position meant but applying it to a website where there's multiple positions it really helped. <br>I struggled on positioning my divs correctly so they all were coherent with each other.</figcaption>

      <h4>Chatbot</h4>
      <a href="https://diegosan17.github.io/Diego-Santos-Chatbot/" target="_blank"><img src="asd.png" alt="chatbot" id="bot"></a>
      <figcaption>We had to make a chatbot where you would send a message and it would appear in the feed.<br> The most important thing I learned while making the chatbot was the append feature.<br> Append was also the thing I struggled with the most, but after trying to understand it better with the help from my teacher I was able to complete the chatbot.</figcaption>

      <h4>Basketball Counter</h4>
      <a href="https://diegosan17.github.io/71-Variables-IP-Basketball-Score-Counter/" target="_blank"><img src="bball.png" alt="basketballgame" id="counter"></a>
      <figcaption>For the Basketball Counter we had to use our skills of jquery to keep a counter for how many points were scored in the game. <br>I learned how to make a counter with jquery. <br>I had prior knowledge of how to make a counter in python and used that knowledge to overcome the challenge of making my counter work. </figcaption>

      <h4>College Packing List</h4>
      <a href="https://diegosan17.github.io/Diego-Santos-College-Packing-List/" target="_blank"><img src="college.png" alt="collegepacking" id="college"></a>
      <figcaption>For the college packing list we had to use buttons to append items on to a list.<br> I learned how to use the click function better. <br>This was something I previously worked on but still struggled. So having this extra practice was really good for me.</figcaption>

      <h4>Gallary Project</h4>
      <a href="https://diegosan17.github.io/Diego-Santos-Gallary-Project/" target="_blank"><img src="gallary.png" alt="gallary" id="gallary"></a>
      <figcaption>For this gallary project we had to make a gallary of images that fit a theme. <br> For this project we had to use our knowledge of lists in Jquery to be able to add an image link into the gallary. <br>This project provided me with more practice with using the .push method aswell as .append. </figcaption>
      <h4>Human Trafficking</h4>
      <a href="https://diegosan17.github.io/Human-Trafficking/" target="_blank"><img src="human.png" alt="human" id="human"></a>
      <figcaption>For this project we were faced with the challenge to provide a call to<br> action for an issue and my group and I landed on Human Trafficking. This project tested our knowledge that weâ€™ve gained so far throughout <br>the year. Whether that be jquery, flexboxes, or even things we learned last year as well. This project helped me practice the<br> skills that we already learned. </figcaption>
